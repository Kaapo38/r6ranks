# Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege rank's images
*In Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege every rank is identified by an id, which is a number. Starting from 0 to represent the lowest rank ("Unranked") up to 36 to represent the highest rank ("Champion"), in this repository you can find every rank icon.*
- DISCLAMER:
*The champion rank icon that you will find in this repository does not have any number (the number displayed on the champion's icon represent the position of the player in the Ubisoft leaderboard of champions players).*
